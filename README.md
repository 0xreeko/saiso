## About Saiso 🤓
Hey 👋 0xreeko here. I've created Siaso as a means to help me & fellow solopreneurs collect feedback from their users. The reason why I chose Notion is because it's a tool with great capabilities that can help optimise certain process for us solopreneurs. The goal with Saiso is to help us, you and me, create better product-led solutions that satisfy our users.

Since Nextjs (React) is my current go-to tool, it currently supports the React ecosystem (Reactjs, Nextjs). If you want to see Saiso support other frontend ecosystems like Vanilla or other frameworks, I'm open to any help since this project is Open Source!🔥

## Benefits
1. Your data is **yours**. Saiso does not store any data, it's just merely a middleman that facilitates feedback collection.
2. Powered by Notion, so you can have centralised way to collect and view your information. You can expand the functionality further!
3. Saiso is niche-agnostic. You can plug it in any website and start collecting feedback in seconds.
4. You get to focus on iterating & shipping, while Saiso handles the rest.
5. It doesn't hinder the user experience on your website 😎
6. Open Source - duh!
